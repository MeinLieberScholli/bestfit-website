        <h3><strong>4.1. Login via mobile apps</strong></h3>
        <p>When registering via the mobile app, the conclusion of the user contract depends on the rules of the respective provider of the store (e.g. Apple, Google, etc.). As a rule, the contract is concluded when you click on the Install field in the respective store and, if necessary, enter your password. Please note that the use of the BestFit service nevertheless requires the opening of a free user account with BestFit.</p>
        <h3><strong>4.2. Conclusion of a contract for one-off additional services or subscriptions against payment</strong></h3>
        <p>You can purchase individual additional services either by paying a one-time fee or within a subscription. If you purchase the additional service via your mobile app, the contract is concluded when you click on the „Buy now“ field or a comparable field as part of an in-app purchase and, if necessary, enter your password for the respective app store.</p>
        <h3><strong>4.3. Correction of input errors</strong></h3>
        <p>If you would like to purchase a one-time additional service via our mobile app or a subscription via in-app purchase, we will not request any further billing or payment data from you, as you purchase the service via your account with your app store provider. Please contact them if you want to correct any input errors.</p>
        <h2><strong>5. Term of validity</strong></h2>
        <p>For the respective term, reference is made to the individual service descriptions of the individual subscriptions and/or services booked by you.</p>
        <p>The individual subscriptions and/or recurring services booked by you end automatically with the expiration of time, without the need for cancellation.</p>
        <p>You hereby expressly authorize BestFit in advance (and without renewed consent of the respective customer) to inform you about the possibility of the extension of the subscription and/or renewed purchase of the services by e-mail and „InApp Push“ messages 4 (four) weeks before the end of the subscription and/or renewed purchase of the services in the case of the expiration of a subscription booked by you and/or recurring services.</p>
        <p>If the collection of the fee owed by you is not possible for any reason, you agree to pay it (also exclusively using one of the means of payment listed under point 8) within 2 (two) weeks from the corresponding payment request by BestFit.</p>
        <p>The legal right of termination by you or BestFit for important reasons remains reserved. For BestFit an important reason exists in particular if the customer does not fulfill the health requirements mentioned in number 3. Furthermore, if the customer violates his duties from number 9 and does not stop his behavior within a reasonable period of time despite a corresponding request by the provider or if he eliminates the disturbing condition or repeats the objected violation.</p>
        <p>To avoid misunderstandings, please note that the duration of a subscription is calculated according to the calendar and is independent of the duration and scope of your use of the respective BestFit service.</p>
        <h2><strong>6. Terms of payment</strong></h2>
        <p>If additional services are purchased by payment of a one-off amount, the fees shall be collected upon conclusion of the contract.</p>

        <h3><strong>9.4. Product liability</strong></h3>
        <p>Claims under the Product Liability Act shall remain unaffected by the aforementioned exclusions or limitations of liability.</p>
        <h2><strong>10. Operation of the range of services</strong></h2>
        <p>BestFit always endeavors to ensure the proper operation of the services offered but does not assume any responsibility or liability for the uninterrupted usability of the Internet, mobile app and e-mail offer and all other program services and their individual functions, in particular not for technical delays, interruptions and failures. You will not be entitled to any claims whatsoever.</p>
        <h2><strong>11. Rights of use for BestFit contents</strong></h2>
        <p>The services offered by BestFit include, depending on which services you are activated for or which you have purchased, copyrighted or otherwise protected content, to which BestFit is entitled to corresponding rights. BestFit grants you a simple and non-transferable right to use these contents in a non-commercial form within the framework of the contractual provisions.</p>
        <h2><strong>12. Responsibility for user-generated content</strong></h2>
        <h3><strong>12.1. No responsibility for external content</strong></h3>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the content you upload within the BestFit services. BestFit does not check them.</p>
        <h3><strong>12.2. No legal infringements</strong></h3>
        <p>When providing your own content, you are obliged to observe all applicable laws and other legal provisions of the Federal Republic of Germany. Irrespective of whether this constitutes a criminal offense, it is generally prohibited to provide content that is pornographic, sexual, violent, racist, inciting to hatred, discriminatory, insulting and/or defamatory in nature.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, you are obligated not to infringe the rights of third parties. This applies in particular to the personal rights of third parties as well as intellectual or industrial property rights of third parties (e.g. copyrights, trademark rights, etc.). In particular, you must also be the owner of the necessary rights to your profile picture and other photos posted by you.</p>
        <p>BestFit is entitled at any time to delete or remove content that is illegal or violates the aforementioned principles. If you violate the aforementioned principles, we are entitled to warn you or temporarily block your user account or terminate the user contract for a good cause in accordance with Section 15.3.</p>
        <h3><strong>12.3. Exemption</strong></h3>
        <p>In the event that you violate the principles stated in Section 12.2 and are at fault (i.e. either negligently or intentionally), you are obliged to indemnify us against claims by third parties based on such violation. We reserve the right to assert claims for damages and other claims.</p>
        <h2><strong>13. Contract termination</strong></h2>
        <h3><strong>13.1. Contract of use</strong></h3>
        <p>You have the right to delete your user account at any time and without giving reasons and thus terminate your user contract. All you have to do is make the necessary settings in your profile. Please note that after deletion of your user account all content and training services of BestFit will be deleted or could be deleted after twenty-four (24) months and you also have no access to already acquired content. If, at the time of deletion of your account, you still have a current subscription or have booked an additional service whose term has not yet ended, any amount already paid by you will not be refunded – not even pro-rata.</p>
        <p>BestFit is entitled to terminate the user contract without giving reasons with a notice period of two (2) weeks in text form, but at the earliest at the end of the minimum term or the respective extension period of your subscription and/or at the end of the term of a one-time paid additional service.</p>
        <h3><strong>13.2. Subscription</strong></h3>
        <p>Each subscription for a BestFit service must be canceled individually. You can cancel the respective subscription at any time without giving reasons with effect to the end of the minimum term or to the end of the respective extension period. In-App purchased subscriptions must be canceled in the settings of the respective store. If your subscription fee is collected via iTunes, a cancellation period of 24 hours to the end of the minimum term or to the end of the respective renewal period will apply, in contrast to the aforementioned for technical reasons. Upon termination of a subscription, your user account and other subscriptions will remain in effect, subject to further termination.</p>
        <h3><strong>13.3. Termination for cause</strong></h3>
        <p>The right to terminate for good cause shall remain unaffected for both parties. In particular, BestFit is entitled to terminate the user contract or your subscription with immediate effect and to delete your user account if you seriously or repeatedly violate the provisions of the user contract and/or these General Terms and Conditions or are in default with your payment obligations despite a reminder.</p>
        <h2><strong>14. Personal data</strong></h2>
        <p>BestFit processes your personal data in accordance with our privacy policy, which you can access <a href="https://bestfit.app/datenschutz">here </a>in its current version. In particular, the data protection regulations regulate and clarify the extent to which your personal data is visible to other users and what options you have to control the transfer to other users.</p>
        <h2><strong>15. Changes to the General Terms and Conditions</strong></h2>
        <p>BestFit reserves the right to change and adapt these general terms and conditions with effect for the future. BestFit will inform you about the changes by e-mail at least two (2) weeks before the planned entry into force of the new version of the General Terms and Conditions. If you do not contradict the validity of the new General Terms and Conditions within this period and continue to use BestFit, the new General Terms and Conditions will be deemed accepted. In case of objection, BestFit expressly reserves its ordinary right of termination. BestFit will also inform you separately about your right of objection, the deadline for this and the legal consequences of your silence or an objection.</p>
        <h2><strong>16. Obligations of the customer</strong></h2>
        <h3><strong>16.1. Obligation to secrecy</strong></h3>
        <p>You are obliged to keep your access data for the user profile, in particular, but not limited to the password for access, secret and secure against access by third parties and to neither tolerate nor enable third parties to gain knowledge of them. In case of misuse or loss of the password or a corresponding suspicion, you have to inform BestFit immediately.</p>
        <h3><strong>16.2. Correct data entries</strong></h3>
        <p>You are obliged to provide all information requested by BestFit during the registration of the customer profile as well as during the booking of the individual program offers, correctly, completely and truthfully.</p>

        <h2><strong>17. Final provisions</strong></h2>
        <h3><strong>17.1. Applicable law</strong></h3>
        <p>German law shall apply exclusively between the parties to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). In business transactions with consumers within the European Union, the law of the consumer’s place of residence may also be applicable, insofar as it concerns mandatory consumer law provisions.</p>
        <h3><strong>17.2. Place of jurisdiction</strong></h3>
        <p>If you do not have a general place of jurisdiction in Germany or in another EU member state or if you have moved your permanent residence to a country outside the EU after these General Terms and Conditions have come into effect or if your place of residence or habitual abode is not known at the time the action is filed, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract is our place of business.</p>
        <h3><strong>17.3. Contract language</strong></h3>
        <p>The contract language is English.</p>
        <h3><strong>17.4. Severability clause</strong></h3>
        <p>Should individual provisions of this contract be invalid or unenforceable or become invalid or unenforceable after conclusion of the contract, this shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the contract. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid or enforceable provision whose effects come closest to the economic objective pursued by BestFit and you with the invalid or unenforceable provision. The above provisions apply accordingly in the event that the conditions prove to be incomplete.</p>
